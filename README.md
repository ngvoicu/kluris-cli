# Kluris

> Turn your AI agents into team subject matter experts.

*When your best engineer sleeps, Kluris doesn't. When they leave, Kluris stays.*

## What is Kluris?

Kluris gives every AI agent on your team shared knowledge -- architecture,
decisions, conventions, learnings -- so they work like an SME who knows your
entire codebase, not a generic assistant starting from scratch every time.

Knowledge is stored in a **brain**: a git-backed repo of structured markdown
that agents read, search, and apply automatically. The human and agent curate
the brain together -- the agent proposes what to document, the human reviews
and approves every piece.

### Why not a wiki, Notion, or CLAUDE.md?

- **Wikis and Notion** are for humans. Agents can't read them, search across
  them, or write back. A brain is markdown in git -- AI-native.
- **CLAUDE.md** is per-project and per-tool. A brain sits above all your
  projects and works with every AI agent on the team.
- **Agent memory** is agent-controlled -- the agent decides what to keep.
  A brain is human-curated -- you decide what goes in, review every entry,
  and correct anything that's wrong.

One brain serves all your projects. Every agent reads the same knowledge.
Version-controlled, human-curated, shared across the entire team.

## Install

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath
```

**Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx && pipx ensurepath
```

**Windows:**
```bash
pip install pipx && pipx ensurepath
```

Then restart your terminal and:

```bash
pipx install kluris
```

## Quick start

```bash
kluris doctor        # check prerequisites
kluris create        # interactive wizard -- name, type, location, git
```

Then open any project directory and use `/kluris`:

```
/kluris learn everything about this service
```

The agent analyzes your code and walks you through each finding one at a
time. You see a small preview before anything is written, and you approve, edit,
or skip every piece.

### Joining an existing brain

```bash
kluris clone git@github.com:team/brain.git    # clone and register
```

### Learning a project

Open any project directory and use `/kluris` -- the agent analyzes your code
and walks you through each finding. You review, edit, and approve before
anything is written.

```
/kluris learn the API endpoints and data model
/kluris learn the Docker and deployment setup
/kluris learn everything about this service
```

The agent starts with a preview before writing. You can change the
target lobe, edit the content, add context the code doesn't show, or skip.

### Storing decisions and knowledge

```
/kluris remember we chose raw SQL over JPA for query complexity
/kluris remember all timestamps must be TIMESTAMPTZ
/kluris create a decision record about the auth architecture
/kluris create an incident report for the January outage
```

### Using brain knowledge while coding

```
/kluris search auth flow
/kluris search Docker setup
/kluris what do we know about the auth flow?
/kluris implement the new endpoint following our conventions
/kluris fix the token refresh -- use brain knowledge
```

The agent reads the brain first, then works on the task. If your code
contradicts a documented decision, it flags the conflict.

### Maintaining the brain

```bash
kluris dream         # regenerate maps, fix links, validate structure
kluris push          # commit and push to git (if brain uses git)
kluris status        # brain tree, neuron counts, recent changes
kluris mri --open    # generate and open in browser
```

## What a brain looks like

```
acme-brain/
├── kluris.yml              # Local config (gitignored -- your agents, branch)
├── brain.md                # Root lobes directory (auto-generated)
├── glossary.md             # Domain terms (hand-edited)
├── README.md               # Usage guide
├── projects/
│   ├── map.md              # Lobe index (auto-generated)
│   └── btb-core/
│       ├── map.md
│       ├── data-model.md   # <- neuron
│       └── auth-flow.md    # <- neuron
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── map.md
│   ├── docker-builds.md    # <- neuron
│   └── environments.md     # <- neuron
└── knowledge/
    ├── map.md
    └── use-raw-sql.md      # <- neuron (decision template)
```

Folders are **lobes** (knowledge regions). Files are **neurons** (knowledge
units). Links between neurons are **synapses**. Auto-generated `map.md` files
keep everything navigable.

## Brain types (scaffolding only)

Types determine the initial folder structure. After creation, every brain
works the same -- all templates and commands are available regardless of type.
You can add or remove lobes freely after creation.

### product-group (default)

For a group of projects/services that share knowledge. Example: a platform
with 3 backends, a frontend, and shared infrastructure.

| Lobe | What goes in it |
|------|----------------|
| `projects/` | Per-project sub-folders -- APIs, data models, setup, conventions |
| `infrastructure/` | Hosting, CI/CD, Docker, deployment, environments, env vars |
| `knowledge/` | Decisions, learnings, troubleshooting tips, domain expertise |

The `projects/` lobe nests deeper -- one sub-folder per project:

```
projects/
├── map.md
├── btb-core/
│   ├── map.md
│   ├── auth-flow.md
│   └── endpoints/
│       ├── map.md
│       └── post-auth-login.md
├── btb-frontend/
│   ├── map.md
│   └── state-management.md
└── btb-summon/
    └── map.md
```

Project neurons link to infrastructure neurons for deployment details
and environments -- never duplicate infra content across lobes.

### personal

For an individual developer's knowledge -- projects, tasks, and notes.

| Lobe | What goes in it |
|------|----------------|
| `projects/` | Sub-folder per project: branches, status, TODOs |
| `tasks/` | Current priorities, blockers, in-progress work |
| `notes/` | Daily notes, ideas, learnings |

### product

For product management -- requirements, features, and user research.

| Lobe | What goes in it |
|------|----------------|
| `prd/` | Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria |
| `features/` | Sub-folder per feature: specs, status, feedback |
| `ux/` | User research, personas, journey maps, wireframes |
| `analytics/` | Metrics, KPIs, experiment results |
| `competitors/` | Competitive analysis, market positioning |
| `decisions/` | Product decisions and rationale |

### research

For research projects -- literature, experiments, and findings.

| Lobe | What goes in it |
|------|----------------|
| `literature/` | Papers, articles, summaries, key findings |
| `experiments/` | Hypotheses, methodology, results |
| `findings/` | Synthesized insights, conclusions |
| `datasets/` | Data sources, schemas, access notes |
| `tools/` | Research tools, scripts, environments |
| `questions/` | Open questions, hypotheses to test |

### blank

Empty -- build your own structure from scratch.

## How it works

1. `kluris create` -- create a brain (interactive wizard)
2. `kluris install-skills` -- give the `/kluris` skill to your AI agents
3. Open any project and use `/kluris` -- the agent becomes an SME
4. Agent and human curate the brain together -- you review and approve every entry
5. `kluris dream` -- maintain brain structure
6. `kluris mri` -- visualize the brain

## CLI commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `kluris create` | Create a new SME brain (interactive wizard) |
| `kluris clone <url>` | Clone an SME brain from git |
| `kluris list` | List registered SME brains |
| `kluris use <name>` | Switch the active SME brain |
| `kluris status` | Brain tree, neuron counts, recent changes |
| `kluris neuron <name>` | Create a neuron (optionally with `--lobe` and `--template`) |
| `kluris lobe <name>` | Create a new lobe (optionally with `--parent` for nesting) |
| `kluris dream` | Regenerate maps, fix links, validate structure |
| `kluris push` | Commit and push brain changes to git |
| `kluris mri` | Visualize the brain (opens in browser by default) |
| `kluris templates` | List available neuron templates |
| `kluris install-skills` | Install the `/kluris` skill for your AI agents |
| `kluris uninstall-skills` | Remove the `/kluris` skill from AI agent directories |
| `kluris remove <name>` | Unregister an SME brain (keeps files on disk) |
| `kluris doctor` | Check prerequisites (git, Python, config) |
| `kluris help` | Show command help |

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output.
The CLI is for mechanical operations. Search and guided documentation happen through `/kluris` inside your agent.

## Neuron templates

Available in every brain. Use `kluris templates` to see them.

| Template | Sections |
|----------|----------|
| `decision` | Context, Decision, Rationale, Alternatives considered, Consequences |
| `incident` | Summary, Timeline, Root cause, Impact, Resolution, Lessons learned |
| `runbook` | Purpose, Prerequisites, Steps, Rollback, Contacts |

## Local config (kluris.yml)

Each brain has a `kluris.yml` that is **gitignored** -- it's your local config,
not shared. Each team member can have different settings.

```yaml
name: my-brain
description: my-brain knowledge base
git:
  default_branch: main
  commit_prefix: "brain:"
```

## Brain vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Brain** | Git repo of shared team knowledge |
| **Lobe** | Folder / knowledge region |
| **Neuron** | Single knowledge file |
| **Synapse** | Link between neurons (bidirectional) |
| **Map** | `map.md` -- auto-generated lobe index |
| **MRI** | Interactive brain visualization |
| **Dream** | Brain maintenance -- regenerate maps, update dates, auto-fix safe issues, validate remaining links |
