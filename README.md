# Kluris

> Create and manage git-backed AI brains for multi-project, multi-agent teams.

*When your best engineer sleeps, Kluris doesn't. When they leave, Kluris stays.*

## What is Kluris?

Kluris is a CLI tool that creates **brains** -- standalone git repos of
structured markdown that AI coding agents read, search, and update through
globally installed slash commands.

**Kluris = the tool. A brain = the git repo it creates.**

### Why not a wiki, Notion, or CLAUDE.md?

- **Wikis and Notion** are for humans. Agents can't natively read them, search
  across them, or write back. Kluris brains are markdown in git -- AI-native.
- **CLAUDE.md** is per-project and per-tool. A brain sits above all your
  projects and works with 8 different AI agents simultaneously.
- **Agent memory** is session-scoped and ephemeral. A brain is persistent,
  version-controlled, and shared across the entire team.

One brain serves all your projects. Every AI agent on the team reads the same
knowledge. When someone leaves, nothing is lost.

## Quick start

```bash
pipx install kluris
kluris doctor        # Check prerequisites
kluris create        # Interactive wizard
```

By default, `kluris create <name>` makes a local git repo with no remote.
Add `--remote <url>` to connect one, or `--no-git` to skip git entirely.

Or skip the wizard:

```bash
kluris create my-brain --type product-group
kluris create my-brain --type personal --path ~/brains
kluris create my-brain --remote git@github.com:team/brain.git
```

Then open any project and run `/kluris.learn` -- the AI agent will analyze
your codebase and populate the brain with architecture, conventions, APIs,
and decisions.

### Example workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a brain (wizard or one-liner)
kluris create

# 2. In your backend project, run the slash command:
#    /kluris.learn focus on architecture and API design

# 3. In your frontend project:
#    /kluris.learn focus on components and state management

# 4. Now any agent in any project can use the brain:
#    /kluris.think implement the new auth flow
#    (agent loads architecture decisions, API contracts, conventions)

# 5. After a session with useful decisions:
#    /kluris.remember

# 6. Validate and push
kluris dream         # Regenerate maps, validate links
kluris push          # Commit and push to git

# 7. Visualize the brain
kluris mri           # Generate brain-mri.html
```

## What a brain looks like

```

Folders are **lobes** (knowledge regions). Files are **neurons** (knowledge
units). Links between neurons are **synapses**. Auto-generated `map.md` files
keep everything navigable.

## Brain types (scaffolding only)

Types determine the initial folder structure. After creation, every brain
works the same -- all templates and commands are available regardless of type.
You can add or remove lobes freely after creation.

### product-group (default)

For a group of projects/services that share knowledge. Example: a platform
with 3 backends, a frontend, and shared infrastructure.

| Lobe | What goes in it |
|------|----------------|
| `architecture/` | System design, technical patterns, data flow, tech stack choices |
| `decisions/` | ADRs and key decisions across all domains (tech, product, business) |
| `product/` | PRDs, roadmap, features, user research |
| `standards/` | Coding standards, naming conventions, review checklists |
| `services/` | Per-service sub-folders -- each service gets its own map.md, APIs, data models |
| `infrastructure/` | Hosting, CI/CD, Docker, networking, deployment, environments |
| `cortex/` | Runbooks, playbooks, dev workflows, onboarding, migration plans |
| `wisdom/` | Domain knowledge, learnings, things figured out along the way |

The `services/` lobe nests deeper -- one sub-folder per service:

```
services/
├── map.md
├── btb-backend/
│   ├── map.md
│   ├── auth-flow.md
│   └── endpoints/
│       ├── map.md
│       └── post-auth-login.md
├── btb-frontend/
│   ├── map.md
│   └── state-management.md
└── btb-summon/
    └── map.md
```

### personal

For an individual developer's knowledge -- projects, tasks, and notes.

| Lobe | What goes in it |
|------|----------------|
| `projects/` | Sub-folder per project: branches, status, TODOs |
| `tasks/` | Current priorities, blockers, in-progress work |
| `notes/` | Daily notes, ideas, learnings |

### product

For product management -- requirements, features, and user research.

| Lobe | What goes in it |
|------|----------------|
| `prd/` | Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria |
| `features/` | Sub-folder per feature: specs, status, feedback |
| `ux/` | User research, personas, journey maps, wireframes |
| `analytics/` | Metrics, KPIs, experiment results |
| `competitors/` | Competitive analysis, market positioning |
| `decisions/` | Product decisions and rationale |

### research

For research projects -- literature, experiments, and findings.

| Lobe | What goes in it |
|------|----------------|
| `literature/` | Papers, articles, summaries, key findings |
| `experiments/` | Hypotheses, methodology, results |
| `findings/` | Synthesized insights, conclusions |
| `datasets/` | Data sources, schemas, access notes |
| `tools/` | Research tools, scripts, environments |
| `questions/` | Open questions, hypotheses to test |

### blank

Empty -- build your own structure from scratch.

## How it works

1. `kluris create` scaffolds a brain (interactive wizard or flags)
2. `kluris install-commands` generates slash commands for 8 AI agents
3. Use `/kluris.learn <focus>` to document specific aspects of each project
4. Use `/kluris.think <task>` to load brain context before working
5. `kluris dream` regenerates maps and validates links
6. `kluris mri` generates an interactive HTML visualization

## Slash commands (used inside AI agents)

All slash commands accept free text:

```
/kluris.learn API endpoints
/kluris.learn database schema
/kluris.remember we chose raw SQL over JPA for performance
/kluris.think implement the new auth flow
/kluris.recall what do we know about deployment
```

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/kluris <anything>` | **Main command.** Read, write, or search the brain. |
| `/kluris.think <task>` | Load brain knowledge, work on the task as the team's expert. |
| `/kluris.recall <topic>` | Search the brain and report what it knows (read-only). |
| `/kluris.learn <focus>` | Learn a specific aspect of the project (APIs, schema, auth...). Asks before writing. |
| `/kluris.remember <what>` | Store a specific piece of knowledge. Asks before writing. |
| `/kluris.push [msg]` | Commit and push brain changes to git. |
| `/kluris.dream [focus]` | AI brain analysis. Run `kluris dream` CLI for mechanical fixes. |
| `/kluris.mri` | Generate interactive brain visualization (runs CLI). |

**learn vs remember:** `/kluris.learn` analyzes project code and extracts knowledge.
`/kluris.remember` stores something you tell it directly. Both ask before writing.

**think vs recall:** `/kluris.think` reads the brain then works on your task.
`/kluris.recall` just searches and reports -- doesn't do any work.

## CLI commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `kluris create` | Create a new brain (interactive wizard or `kluris create <name> --type product-group`) |
| `kluris clone` | Clone a brain from git (interactive or `kluris clone <url> --branch develop`) |
| `kluris list` | List all registered brains |
| `kluris status` | Show brain tree, recent changes, neuron counts |
| `kluris recall <query>` | Search brain and show results |
| `kluris dream` | Regenerate maps and neuron index, validate links |
| `kluris push` | Commit and push brain changes to git |
| `kluris mri` | Generate interactive HTML brain visualization |
| `kluris use <name>` | Set the default brain |
| `kluris templates` | List available neuron templates |
| `kluris install-commands` | Install slash commands into AI agent directories |
| `kluris uninstall-commands` | Remove all kluris commands from agent directories |
| `kluris remove <name>` | Unregister a brain (keeps files) |
| `kluris doctor` | Check prerequisites (git, Python, config dir) |
| `kluris help` | Show all commands |

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output.

## Neuron templates

Available in every brain. Use `kluris templates` to see them.

| Template | Sections |
|----------|----------|
| `decision` | Context, Decision, Rationale, Alternatives considered, Consequences |
| `incident` | Summary, Timeline, Root cause, Impact, Resolution, Lessons learned |
| `runbook` | Purpose, Prerequisites, Steps, Rollback, Contacts |

## Local config (kluris.yml)

Each brain has a `kluris.yml` that is **gitignored** -- it's your local config,
not shared. Each team member can have different settings.

```yaml
name: my-brain
description: my-brain knowledge base
git:
  default_branch: main
  commit_prefix: "brain:"
agents:
  commands_for: [claude, cursor, windsurf, copilot, codex, kilocode, gemini, junie]
```

## Brain vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Brain** | Git repo of structured markdown |
| **Lobe** | Folder / knowledge region |
| **Neuron** | Single knowledge file |
| **Synapse** | Link between neurons (bidirectional) |
| **Map** | `map.md` -- auto-generated lobe index |
| **MRI** | Interactive brain visualization |
